# Game-Engine
This project is an engine that currently uses the DirectX 11 API and the OpenGL 4.1 API.

It's a very basic implementation that is work in progress.
To test it out, clone and open the sln file in Visual Studios
It also includes a Networking model that uses UDP sockets although it's not implemented. Only stand-alone.
